<center><b>Moon</b> is a minimal, one column jekyll theme.</center>
     
 I'm not a developer or designer. And I don't add footer to show who did this theme. If you like this theme or using it, please give a **star** for motivation, It makes me happy.

## Layouts and Content

Moon Theme use [Jekyll Compress](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html) to compress html output. But it can cause errors if you use "linenos" (line numbers). I suggest don't use line numbers for codes, because it won't look good with this theme, also i didn't give a proper style for them. If you insist to use line numbers, just remove `layout: compress` string from layouts. It will disable compressing.

### Feature Image

You can set feature image per post. Just add `feature: some link` to your post's front matter.

```
feature: /assets/img/some-image.png
or
feaure: http://example.com/some-image.png
```    
 This also will be used for twitter card:
