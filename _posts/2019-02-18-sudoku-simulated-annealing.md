## A Short Story
Once upon a time, there was a professor who taught Neural Networks at some university. The professor decided that it's a good idea to let the students code and play with many differnt optimization methods to undestand the depth of the field.  

Among the optimization methods were Simulated Annelaing and Genetic Algorithms.  

And among the lucky students was me.  

The professor gave us many projects. And among them was to solve Sudoku puzzles using Simulated Annealing.  
While the idea is not new, and using this optimization method on this kind of puzzles is very inefficient and slow, it wan't actually a bad idea.  
I learned why such methods exist, when to use them, and how to make my own varient of such methods.

## But what is Simulated Annealing?
